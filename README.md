# ecapybara
ecapybara, Elementary Cellular Automata for PYthon

Iterate the 256 [elementary cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton)
starting from a fixed inital state.

## Usage

`python3 ecapybara.py`


You will be prompted to select one of the rules from 0-255, and the number of steps you would like to iterate. Output will be scaled to fit the number of columns in your terminal window with some padding.

## TODO
- Larger number of steps doesn't generate expected output.
- Needs to be modularized.
- Needs unit tests.
- Needs click interface for CLI.
- Needs to write images using PILlow.
- Logging needs work.

## Mascot
The official mascot of ecapybara is the e-capybara.
